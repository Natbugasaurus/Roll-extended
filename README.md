Space Roller is a high speed ball game that requires the player to navigate
a strange crystal structure in space. The stage uses a crystal shader and texture
(from the assest store - Unity Technologies) and the refraction of light from
the skybox (from the asset store - NinjaPretzel) through it makes the level's
obstacles more difficult to discern.
